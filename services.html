<div id="d14"><p id="p2"><h3>Chest Workout</h3>
If you really want to pump up your pecs and build the best chest in the gym, you need targeted chest exercises that exhaust your muscles in the best way possible. Because the main chest muscles (specifically the pectoralis major, aka pecs) are so huge, and contribute to so many movements, you’ll need more than just a handful of moves to build your upper body from every angle.</p>
<p><h3>Legs Workout</h3>
When you think of leg exercises, odds are high your mind goes straight to squats, deadlifts, and variations thereof. But lower body moves enlist more than just your quads and hamstrings. When you do these exercises, you’re not just hitting the major muscles. You also work your core, improve your balance, and hone things like grip strength, which pay dividends in the long run.</p>
<p><h3>Biceps Workout</h3>
Guys typically hit the weights for strength training in hopes of crafting tree trunk legs, boulder shoulders, and six-pack abs—but the most common (and attainable) fitspo goal of all might be building bulging biceps. There's a reason the curl is a universal go-to exercise for dudes from the first moment they heft a dumbbell: they want to get swole, and that starts with the arms. You can't walk around showing off your big legs or your ripped abs all the time in polite society, but big-time biceps are unavoidable.</p>
 <p><h3>Triceps Workout</h3>
They might feel good when you’re repping them out, but crushing curl after curl after curl just isn’t enough if you’re serious about building sleeve-busting arms. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but if you want to develop super-sized arms then you're going to need tricep exercises and tricep workouts.</p>
 <p><h3>Shoulder Workout</h3>
Lifting a weight that’s too heavy for you is a mistake regardless of the part of the body you’re working, but it can be truly disastrous when performing shoulder exercises. The shoulders are delicate and complicated joints that are not especially easy to target, and if you do put them under too much pressure before they’re ready you can end up with injuries that put you out of action for months.
